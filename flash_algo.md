## Flashcard Scheduling Logic and Features

**Last updated: 2025-10-27 - Added Review Drill (English → 한국어) on list page**

### Review Drill (English → 한국어)

- Entry point: On the unit vocabulary list page, click "Review vocabulary list".
- The app shuffles the unit's words and presents them one by one.
- Prompt shows the English word; user must type the Korean translation to advance.
- Correct input advances immediately to the next word; incorrect input shows gentle error feedback and allows retry.
- Progress in this drill does not affect spaced-repetition scheduling; it is a quick, linear practice round.
- Header shows progress (current index / total) and includes an Exit button to return to the list.

Visual feedback:
- Idle: standard card.
- Correct: green accent briefly before advancing.
- Incorrect: red accent with “Try again”.

### Typing Mode Feature

A new typing mode allows users to type their answers directly instead of just revealing them.

**How it works:**
1. Typing mode is toggled via a switch in the header (disabled by default)
2. When enabled, an input field appears instead of "Show answer" button
3. User types their answer
4. Press Enter or click "Check Answer" to submit
5. Feedback is displayed:
   - Green background with "✓ Correct!" for correct answers
   - Red background with "✗ Incorrect" for incorrect answers
6. After showing answer and feedback, user can still use the standard grading buttons (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)

**Answer Checking:**
- Answers are compared after normalizing to lowercase and trimming whitespace
- Works with both prompt side settings (korean → english or english → korean)
- The correct answer is determined based on the current prompt side setting

**State Management:**
- Typing mode preference is saved in localStorage settings
- Typed answer and feedback are reset when moving to next card
- Can be toggled on/off at any time during study session

## Flashcard Scheduling Logic (First Draft)

### Overview
This app uses a lightweight SM‑2–style spaced repetition. Each card keeps a small progress record and is scheduled earlier or later based on your feedback: Again, Hard, Good, or Easy.

### Per‑card progress fields
- **ease**: how quickly the interval grows (range: 1.3–3.0; default 2.5)
- **intervalMs**: current interval in milliseconds
- **repetitions**: number of successful reviews in a row (resets on “Again”)
- **dueAtMs**: epoch time when the card next becomes due
- **lapses**: number of times you failed the card

Initial state for any unseen card:
- ease = 2.5, intervalMs = 0, repetitions = 0, dueAtMs = 0, lapses = 0

### Grading rules
- **Again**:
  - ease -= 0.2 (clamped to ≥ 1.3)
  - interval = 10 seconds
  - repetitions = 0
  - lapses += 1
- **Hard**:
  - ease -= 0.15 (clamped to ≥ 1.3)
  - interval = max(60 seconds, round((interval || 30 seconds) × 1.2))
- **Good**:
  - if repetitions == 0 → interval = 5 minutes
  - else → interval = round(max(2 minutes, (interval || 1 minute) × ease))
  - repetitions += 1
- **Easy**:
  - ease += 0.05 (clamped to ≤ 3.0)
  - if repetitions == 0 → interval = 10 minutes
  - else → interval = round(max(5 minutes, (interval || 1 minute) × ease × 1.3))
  - repetitions += 1

After applying the rule, set:
- dueAtMs = nowMs + intervalMs

Ease is always clamped to the range [1.3, 3.0].

### Pseudocode
```text
function schedule(prev, quality, nowMs):
  ease = clamp(prev.ease, 1.3, 3.0)
  interval = prev.intervalMs
  reps = prev.repetitions
  lapses = prev.lapses

  switch quality:
    case Again:
      ease = clamp(ease - 0.2, 1.3, 3.0)
      interval = 10s
      reps = 0
      lapses += 1
    case Hard:
      ease = clamp(ease - 0.15, 1.3, 3.0)
      interval = max(60s, round((interval or 30s) * 1.2))
    case Good:
      if reps == 0:
        interval = 5m
      else:
        interval = round(max(2m, (interval or 1m) * ease))
      reps = max(1, reps + 1)
    case Easy:
      ease = clamp(ease + 0.05, 1.3, 3.0)
      if reps == 0:
        interval = 10m
      else:
        interval = round(max(5m, (interval or 1m) * ease * 1.3))
      reps = max(1, reps + 1)

  return {
    ease,
    intervalMs: interval,
    repetitions: reps,
    dueAtMs: nowMs + interval,
    lapses,
  }
```

### Card selection
1. For each card, compute `dueAtMs` (default 0 if no stored progress).
2. Sort by `dueAtMs` ascending.
3. Prefer cards with `dueAtMs ≤ now` (due cards). If none are due and “Study ahead” is enabled, show the earliest future card.
4. Show counters: number of due cards and total deck size. Display time until next card if all remaining are in the future.

### Settings and persistence
- Progress is stored in `localStorage` under `flashcards:voc_1:progress`.
- Settings (currently: prompt side `korean` or `english`) are stored under `flashcards:settings`.
- Reset clears only the progress map.

### Notes
- Intervals are intentionally conservative for a first draft; they can be tuned.
- Adding a short “learning” ladder (e.g., 10s → 1m → 5m) before graduating to spaced intervals can improve initial retention.
- Deck used for testing is `public/voc_1.json`.
