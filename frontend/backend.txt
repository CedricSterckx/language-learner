I would like to add a backend in Golang (Go) to go from the localstorage to my own database. I would like to allow users to login via google and handle the users like this. Please make me a plan on how to handle this and all the possible api calls that will be needed. For the database we will use a sqlite database. 
create a multi stage plan on how to execute all this in the best way possible. 
Ask me more questions if you need more context. Be concise in your plan you can sacrifice grammar forthe sake of being concise
